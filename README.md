## Inspiration

Back when it was popular, I loved to play **pokemon go**, so I wanted to make an application similar to it, that gets people to exercise outside while having fun.

## What it does

The app randomly generates coins outside _(10,000 coins within 5 miles in every direction)_ and when you walk close enough to a coin, you pick it up. The goal is to pick up as many as possible. When you get 100 coins, you beat the game.

## How I built it

I used the google maps api and vanilla javascript.

## Challenges I ran into

My first plan was to do the same thing with ar, with coins appearing as you point your camera, however that didn't work well, so I switched to using google maps. I also had to learn the google maps api since it was my first time using it. Moreover, testing the program became very time consuming since I had to upload the code to my phone, then go outside and collect coins whenever I was troubleshooting the program. I also wanted to upload the code to a website, however the geolocation only worked on a secure website, so I resorted to using codepen to host the code.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I made a way to motivate people to go run outside and be more in touch with their community and the environment.

## What I learned

I am now a lot more adept at the google maps api, so if I ever use it in the future, it will be much simpler.

## What's next for Coin Finder

Depending on interest, I may upload it to my website (but first I need an SSL certificate on it). I would also add more applications and possibly try incorporating AR capabilities again.
